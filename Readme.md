# OBSOLETE - How to prevent removing a master record referenced by other records

This solution is obsolete. The best way to validate data in an XAF application is to use the [Validation (Prevent Data Errors)](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/113684/validation-module). Refer to the [RuleIsReferencedAttribute](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.Persistent.Validation.RuleIsReferencedAttribute)Â article for a recommended solution.
